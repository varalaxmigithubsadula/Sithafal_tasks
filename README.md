Chat with PDF using RAG Pipeline:
     This project allows users to upload PDF files, extract text from the PDFs, and query the document for specific information. It also includes functionality to extract tables from specific pages of the uploaded PDF. The app uses machine learning models to process queries using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity for matching text content.
Check this video for clear understanding:

Features:

PDF Text Extraction: Extracts and processes the text content of uploaded PDF files.
Table Extraction: Extracts tables from specific pages of the uploaded PDF.
Query Processing: Allows users to submit queries, which are matched against the extracted text using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
File Upload: Provides a simple interface for uploading PDF files.
Technologies Used:

Flask: Web framework for building the application.
PyPDF2: For text extraction from PDF files.
pdfplumber: For extracting tables from PDFs.
Scikit-learn: For TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity-based query processing.
HTML/CSS: For frontend design (basic form for uploading PDFs and submitting queries).
