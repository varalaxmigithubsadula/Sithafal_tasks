History
Old University of Chicago
The first University of Chicago was founded by a small group ofBaptisteducators in 1856 through a land endowment from SenatorStephen A. Douglas. It closed in 1886 after years of financial struggle and a finalannus horribilisin which the campus was badly damaged by fire and the school was foreclosed on by its creditors.[34]Several years later, its trustees elected to change the school's name to the "Old University of Chicago" so that a new school could go by the name of the city.[35]
Early years
In 1890, theAmerican Baptist Education Societyincorporated a new University of Chicago as acoeducational[36]: 137institution, using $400,000 donated to the ABES to supplement a $600,000 donation fromStandard Oilco-founderJohn D. Rockefeller,[37]and land donated byMarshall Field.[38]While the Rockefeller donation provided money for academic operations and long-term endowment, it was stipulated that such money could not be used for buildings. TheHyde Parkcampus was financed by donations from wealthy Chicagoans such asSilas B. Cobb, who provided the funds for the campus's first building,Cobb Lecture Hall, and matched Marshall Field's pledge of $100,000. Other early benefactors included businessmenCharles L. Hutchinson(trustee, treasurer and donor ofHutchinson Commons),Martin A. Ryerson(president of the board of trustees and donor of the Ryerson Physical Laboratory)Adolphus Clay Bartlettand Leon Mandel, who funded the construction of the gymnasium and assembly hall, and George C. Walker of the Walker Museum, a relative of Cobb who encouraged his inaugural donation for facilities.[39]
The new university acknowledged its predecessor.[40]The university's coat of arms has a phoenix rising from the ashes, a reference to the fire and foreclosure of the Old University of Chicago.[41]A single stone from the rubble of the original Douglas Hall on 34th Place was set into the wall of the Classics Building. The dean of the college and University of Chicago and professor of history John Boyer has argued that the University of Chicago has "a plausible genealogy as a pre–Civil War institution".[42]Alumni from the Old University of Chicago are recognized as alumni of the University of Chicago.[43]
William Rainey Harperbecame the university's president on July 1, 1891, and the Hyde Park campus opened for classes on October 1, 1892.[40]Harper worked on building up the faculty and in two years he had a faculty of 120, including eight former university or college presidents.[44]Harper was an accomplished scholar (Semiticist) and a member of the Baptist clergy who believed that a great university should maintain the study of faith as a central focus.[45]To fulfill this commitment, he brought theBaptistseminary that had begun as an independent school "alongside" the Old University of Chicago and separated from the old school decades earlier to Morgan Park. This became theDivinity Schoolin 1891, the first professional school at the University of Chicago.[36]: 20–22
Harper recruited acclaimed Yale baseball and football playerAmos Alonzo Staggfrom theYoung Men's Christian Associationtraining school atSpringfieldto coach the school's football program.[46]Stagg was given a position on the faculty, the first such athletic position in the United States.[citation needed]While coaching at the university, Stagg invented the numbered football jersey and the huddle.[47]Stagg is the namesake of the university'sStagg Field.[citation needed]
Thebusiness schoolwas founded in 1898,[48]and thelaw schoolwas founded in 1902.[49]Harper died in 1906[50]and was replaced by a succession of three presidents whose tenures lasted until 1929.[51]During this period, theOriental Institutewas founded to support and interpretarcheologicalwork in what was then called the Near East.[52]
In the 1890s, the university, fearful that its vast resources would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students, affiliated with several regional colleges and universities:Des Moines College,Kalamazoo College,Butler University, andStetson University. In 1896, the university affiliated withShimer Collegein Mount Carroll, Illinois. Under the terms of the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except for travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by theUniversity of Chicago Pressat no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university. The program was ended by 1910.[53]
1920s–1980s
In 1929, the university's fifth president, 30-year-old legal philosophy scholarRobert Maynard Hutchins, took office. The university underwent many changes during his 24-year tenure. Hutchins reformed the undergraduate college's liberal-arts curriculum known as the Common Core,[54]organized the university's graduate work into four divisions,[55]and eliminated varsity football from the university in an attempt to emphasize academics over athletics.[55]During his term, the University of Chicago Hospitals (now called theUniversity of Chicago Medical Center) finished construction and enrolled their first medical students.[56]Also, the philosophy orientedCommittee on Social Thought, an institution distinctive of the university, was created.[57]
Money that had been raised during the 1920s and financial backing from theRockefeller Foundationhelped the school to survive through theGreat Depression.[55]Nonetheless, in 1933, Hutchins proposed an unsuccessful plan to merge the University of Chicago andNorthwestern University.[58]During World War II, the university'sMetallurgical Laboratorymade ground-breaking contributions to theManhattan Project.[59]The university was the site of the first isolation ofplutoniumand of the creation of the first artificial, self-sustained nuclear reaction byEnrico Fermiin 1942.[59][60]
The university did not provide standard oversight ofBruno Bettelheimand his tenure as director of theOrthogenic School for Disturbed Childrenfrom 1944 to 1973.[61][62][63]
In the early 1950s, student applications declined as a result of increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood. In response, the university became a major sponsor of a controversialurban renewal project for Hyde Park, which profoundly affected both the neighborhood's architecture and street plan.[64]During this period the university, like Shimer College and 10 others, adopted an early entrant program that allowed very young students to attend college; also, students enrolled at Shimer were enabled to transfer automatically to the University of Chicago after their second year, having taken comparable or identical examinations and courses.[citation needed]
The university experienced its share of student unrest during the 1960s, beginning in 1962 when then-freshmanBernie Sandershelped lead a15-day sit-in at the college's administration buildingin a protest over the university's segregationist off-campus rental policies. After continued turmoil, a university committee in 1967 issued what became known as the Kalven Report. The report, a two-page statement of the university's policy in "social and political action," declared that "To perform its mission in the society, a university must sustain an extraordinary environment of freedom of inquiry and maintain an independence from political fashions, passions, and pressures."[65]The report has since been used to justify decisions such as the university's refusal to divest from South Africa in the 1980s and Darfur in the late 2000s.[66]
In 1969, more than 400 students, angry about the dismissal of a popular professor,Marlene Dixon, occupied the Administration Building for two weeks. After the sit-in ended, when Dixon turned down a one-year reappointment, 42 students were expelled and 81 were suspended,[67]the most severe response to student occupations of any American university during the student movement.[68]
In 1978, history scholarHanna Holborn Gray, then the provost and acting president ofYale University, became president of the University of Chicago, a position she held for 15 years. She was the first woman in the United States to hold the presidency of a major university.[69]
1990s–2010s
In 1999, then-PresidentHugo Sonnenscheinannounced plans to relax the university's famedcore curriculum, reducing the number of required courses from 21 to 15. WhenThe New York Times,The Economist, and other major news outlets picked up this story, the university became the focal point of a national debate on education. The changes were ultimately implemented, but the controversy played a role in Sonnenschein's decision to resign in 2000.[70]
From the mid-2000s, the university began a number of multimillion-dollar expansion projects. In 2008, the University of Chicago announced plans to establish theMilton Friedman Institute, which attracted both support and controversy from faculty members andstudents.[71][72][73][74][75]The institute would cost around $200 million and occupy the buildings of theChicago Theological Seminary. During the same year, investorDavid G. Boothdonated $300 million to the university'sBooth School of Business, which is the largest gift in the university's history and the largest gift ever to any business school.[76]In 2009, planning or construction on several new buildings, half of which cost $100 million or more, was underway.[77]Since 2011, major construction projects have included the Jules and Gwen Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery, a ten-story medical research center, and further additions to the medical campus of theUniversity of Chicago Medical Center.[78]In 2014 the university launched the public phase of a $4.5 billionfundraisingcampaign.[79]In September 2015, the university received $100 million from The Pearson Family Foundation to establish The Pearson Institute for the Study and Resolution of Global Conflicts and The Pearson Global Forum at theHarris School of Public Policy.[80]
In 2019, the university created its first school in three decades, thePritzker School of Molecular Engineering.[81][82]
On April 29, 2024, students at the University of Chicago set upan encampment on the university's main quad[83]as a part ofthe nationwide movementin support of Palestine at institutions of higher learning across the country. The encampment was cleared by the University of Chicago Police Department on May 7.[84]
Campus
Main campus
The main campus of the University of Chicago consists of 217 acres (87.8 ha) in the Chicago neighborhoods ofHyde ParkandWoodlawn, approximately eight miles (13 km) south ofdowntown Chicago. The northern and southern portions of campus are separated by theMidway Plaisance, a large, linear park created for the 1893World's Columbian Exposition. In 2011,Travel+Leisurelisted the university as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.[85]
The first buildings of the campus, which make up what is now known as the Main Quadrangles, were part of a master plan conceived by two University of Chicago trustees and plotted by Chicago architectHenry Ives Cobb.[86]The Main Quadrangles consist of sixquadrangles, each surrounded by buildings, bordering one larger quadrangle.[36]: 221The buildings of the Main Quadrangles were designed by Cobb,Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge,Holabird & Roche, and other architectural firms in a mixture of theVictorian GothicandCollegiate Gothicstyles, patterned on the colleges of the University of Oxford.[86](Mitchell Tower, for example, is modeled after Oxford'sMagdalen Tower,[87]and the university Commons,Hutchinson Hall, replicatesChrist ChurchHall.[88]) In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, the University of Chicago Quadrangles[89]were selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by theAmerican Institute of ArchitectsIllinois component (AIA Illinois).[90]
After the 1940s, the campus's Gothic style began to give way to modern styles.[86]In 1955,Eero Saarinenwas contracted to develop a second master plan, which led to the construction of buildings both north and south of the Midway, including the Laird Bell Law Quadrangle (a complex designed by Saarinen);[86]a series of arts buildings;[86]a building designed byLudwig Mies van der Rohefor the university's School of Social Service Administration,[86]a building which is to become the home of theHarris School of Public PolicybyEdward Durrell Stone, and theRegenstein Library, the largest building on campus, abrutaliststructure designed byWalter Netschof the Chicago firmSkidmore, Owings & Merrill.[91]Another master plan, designed in 1999 and updated in 2004,[92]produced theGerald Ratner Athletics Center(2003),[92]theMax Palevsky Residential Commons(2001),[86]South Campus Residence Halland dining commons (2009), a new children's hospital,[93]and other construction, expansions, and restorations.[94]In 2011, the university completed the glass dome-shapedJoe and Rika Mansueto Library, which provides a grand reading room for the university library and prevents the need for an off-campus book depository.[citation needed]
The site ofChicago Pile-1is aNational Historic Landmarkand is marked by theHenry MooresculptureNuclear Energy.[95]Robie House, aFrank Lloyd Wrightbuilding acquired by the university in 1963, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site[96][97]as well as a National Historic Landmark,[98]as is room 405 of theGeorge Herbert Jones Laboratory, whereGlenn T. Seaborgand his team were the first to isolate plutonium.[99]Hitchcock Hall, an undergraduate dormitory, is on theNational Register of Historic Places.[100]
The campus is soon to be the home of theObama Presidential Center, the Presidential Library for the 44th president of the United States[101][102]with expected completion in 2026. The Obamas settled in the university's Hyde Park neighborhood where they raised their children and whereBarack Obamabegan his political career.Michelle Obamaserved as an administrator at the university and founded the university's Community Service Center.[103]
In November 2021, a university graduate was robbed and fatally shot on a sidewalk in a residential area in Hyde Park near campus;[106][107]a total of three University of Chicago students were killed by gunfire incidents in 2021.[107][106]These incidents prompted student protests and an open letter to university leadership signed by more than 300 faculty members.[108][109]
Satellite campuses
The university also maintains facilities apart from its main campus. The university'sBooth School of Businessmaintains campuses inHong Kong,London, and the downtownStreetervilleneighborhood of Chicago. The Center in Paris, a campus located on theleft bankof theSeinein Paris, hosts various undergraduate and graduate study programs.[110]In fall 2010, the university opened a center in Beijing, nearRenmin University's campus inHaidian District. The most recent additions are a center inNew Delhi, India, which opened in 2014,[111]and a center in Hong Kong which opened in 2018.[112]In 2024, the university opened the John W. Boyer Center in Paris, designed by architectural firm Studio Gang and nearly tripling the size of the Center in Paris which had opened in 2003.[113]
Administration and finance
The university is governed by a board of trustees. The board of trustees oversees the long-term development and plans of the university and manages fundraising efforts, and is composed of 55 members including the university president.[114]Directly beneath the president are the provost, fourteen vice presidents (including the chief financial officer,chief investment officer, and vice president for campus life and student services), the directors ofArgonne National LaboratoryandFermilab, the secretary of the university, and the studentombudsperson.[115]As of May 2022, the current chairman of the board of trustees isDavid Rubenstein.[116]The current provost isKatherine Baickersince March 2023.[117][118]The current president of the University of Chicago is chemistPaul Alivisatos, who assumed the role on September 1, 2021.Robert Zimmer, the previous president, transitioned into the new role of chancellor of the university.[119]
The university's endowment was the 12th largest among American educational institutions and state university systems in 2013[120]and as of 2020[update]was valued at $10 billion.[121]Since 2016, the university's board of trustees has resisted pressure from students and faculty to divest its investments from fossil fuel companies.[122]Part of former university President Zimmer's financial plan for the university was an increase in accumulation of debt to finance large building projects.[123]This drew both support and criticism from many in the university community.[citation needed]In 2023 the university agreed to pay $13.5 million to settle a lawsuit that it and other universities conspired to limit financial aid to students.[124]
Academics
The academic bodies of the University of Chicago consist of theCollege, four divisions of graduate research, seven professional schools, and theGraham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies.[125]The university also contains a library system, theUniversity of Chicago Press, and theUniversity of Chicago Medical Center, and oversees several laboratories, includingFermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab),Argonne National Laboratory, and theMarine Biological Laboratory. The university is accredited byThe Higher Learning Commission.[126]
The university runs on aquarter systemin which the academic year is divided into four terms: Summer (June–August), Autumn (September–December), Winter (January–March), and Spring (April–June).[127]Full-time undergraduate students take three to four courses every quarter[128]for approximately nine weeks before their quarterly academic breaks. The school year typically begins in late September and ends in late May.[127]
Reputation and rankings
After its foundation in the late 19th century, the University of Chicago quickly became established as one of the wealthiest and, according to Henry S. Webber, one of the most prestigious universities in America.[136]To elevate higher education standards and practices, the university was a founder of theAssociation of American Universitiesin 1900.[137]According toJonathan R. Cole, universities such as Chicago leveraged endowments to fund research, attracting accomplished faculty and producing academic advancements, leading to sustained growth and maintenance of their institutional profile such that Chicago has been among the most distinguished research universities in the US for more than a century.[138]The university is described by theEncyclopedia Britannicaas "one of the United States' most outstanding universities".[139]
ARWUhas consistently placed the University of Chicago among the top 10 universities in the world,[140]and the 2021QS World University Rankingsplaced the university in 9th place worldwide.[141]THE World University Rankingshas ranked it among the global top 10 for eleven consecutive years (from 2012 to 2022).[142]
The university'slawandbusinessschools rank among the top three professional schools in the United States.[143]The business school is currently ranked first in the US byUS News & World Report[144]and first in the world byThe Economist,[145]while the law school is ranked third byUS News & World Report[146]and first byAbove the Law.[147]

Undergraduate students are required to take a distribution of courses to satisfy the university's general education requirements, commonly known as the Core Curriculum.[155]In 2012–2013, the Core classes at Chicago were limited to 17 courses, and are generally led by a full-time professor (as opposed to ateaching assistant).[156]As of the 2013–2014 school year, 15 courses and demonstrated proficiency in a foreign language are required under the Core.[157]Undergraduate courses at the University of Chicago are known for their demanding standards, heavy workload and academic difficulty; according toUni in the USA, "Among the academic cream of American universities – Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, and the University of Chicago – it is UChicago that can most convincingly claim to provide the most rigorous, intense learning experience."[158]
Graduate schools and committees
The university graduate schools and committees are divided into four divisions: Biological Sciences, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences, and eight professional schools.[159]In the autumn quarter of 2022, the university enrolled 10,546 graduate students on degree-seeking courses: 569 in the Biological Sciences Division, 612 in the Humanities Division, 2,103 in the Physical Sciences Division, 972 in the Social Sciences Division, and 6,290 in the professional schools (including the Graham School).[160]

It operates theUniversity of Chicago Laboratory Schools(a privateday schoolforK-12students andday care),[163]and a publiccharter schoolwith four campuses on theSouth Sideof Chicago administered by the university's Urban Education Institute.[164]In addition, the Hyde Park Day School, a school for students with learning disabilities,[165]and theSonia Shankman Orthogenic School, a residential treatment program for those with behavioral and emotional problems,[166]maintains a location on the University of Chicago campus. Since 1983, the University of Chicago has maintained theUniversity of Chicago School Mathematics Project, a mathematics program used in urban primary and secondary schools.[167]The university runs a program called the Council on Advanced Studies in the Humanities and Social Sciences, which administers interdisciplinary workshops to provide a forum for graduate students, faculty, and visiting scholars to present scholarly work in progress.[168]The university also operates theUniversity of Chicago Press, the largestuniversity pressin the United States.[169]
TheUniversity of Chicago Librarysystem encompasses six libraries that contain a total of 11 million volumes, the 9th most among library systems in the United States.[170]The university's main library is theRegenstein Library, which contains one of the largest collections of print volumes in the United States. TheJoe and Rika Mansueto Library, built in 2011, houses a large study space and an automated book storage and retrieval system. TheJohn Crerar Librarycontains more than 1.4 million volumes in the biological, medical and physical sciences and collections in general science and the philosophy and history of science, medicine, and technology.[171]The university also operates a number of special libraries, including the D'Angelo Law Library, the Social Service Administration Library, and the Eckhart Library for mathematics and computer science.[172][173]Harper Memorial Library is now a reading and study room.
Research
According to theNational Science Foundation, University of Chicago spent $423.9 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 60th in the nation.[174]It isclassifiedamong "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity"[175]and is a founding member of theAssociation of American Universitiesand was a member of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation from 1946 through June 29, 2016, when the group's name was changed to theBig Ten Academic Alliance. The University of Chicago is not a member of the rebranded consortium, but will continue to be a collaborator.[176][177]
The university operates more than 140 research centers and institutes on campus.[178]Among these are theInstitute for the Study of Ancient Cultures, West Asia & North Africa—a museum and research center forNear Easternstudies owned and operated by the university—and a number ofNational Resource Centers, including theCenter for Middle Eastern Studies. Chicago also operates or is affiliated with several research institutions apart from the university proper. The university managesArgonne National Laboratory, part of theUnited States Department of Energy's national laboratory system, and co-managesFermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), a nearby particle physics laboratory, as well as a stake in theApache Point ObservatoryinSunspot, New Mexico. Faculty and students at the adjacentToyota Technological Institute at Chicagocollaborate with the university.[179]In 2013, the university formed an affiliation with the formerly independentMarine Biological Laboratoryin Woods Hole, Mass.[180]TheNational Opinion Research Centermaintains an office at the Hyde Park campus and is affiliated with multiple academic centers and institutes.[181][182]
The University of Chicago has been the site of some important experiments and academic movements. In economics, the university has played an important role in shaping ideas about thefree market[183]and is the namesake of theChicago school of economics, the school of economic thought supported byMilton Friedmanand other economists. The university'ssociologydepartment was the first independent sociology department in the United States and gave birth to theChicago school of sociology.[184]In physics, the university was the site of theChicago Pile-1(the first controlled, self-sustaining human-made nuclear chain reaction, part of theManhattan Project), ofRobert Millikan'soil-drop experimentthat calculated the charge of the electron,[185]and of the development ofradiocarbon datingbyWillard F. Libbyin 1947. The chemical experiment that tested how life originated on early Earth, theMiller–Urey experiment, was conducted at the university.REM sleepwas discovered at the university in 1953 byNathaniel KleitmanandEugene Aserinsky.[186]
The University of Chicago (Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics) operated theYerkes ObservatoryinWilliams Bay, Wisconsinfrom 1897 until 2018,[187]where the largest operatingrefracting telescopein the world and other telescopes are located.[citation needed]
Arts
The UChicago Arts program joins academic departments and programs in the Division of the Humanities and the college, as well as professional organizations including theCourt Theatre, theInstitute for the Study of Ancient Cultures, West Asia & North Africa, theSmart Museum of Art, theRenaissance Society, University of Chicago Presents, and student arts organizations. The university has an artist-in-residence program and scholars in performance studies, contemporary art criticism, and film history.

In 2018, the University of Chicago attracted national headlines by becoming the first major research university to no longer require SAT/ACT scores from college applicants.[201]
Athletics
The University of Chicago hosts 19 varsity sports teams: 10 men's teams and 9 women's teams,[202]all called theMaroons, with 502 students participating in the 2012–2013 school year.[202]
The Maroons compete in theNCAA'sDivision IIIas members of theUniversity Athletic Association(UAA). The university was a founding member of theBig Ten Conferenceand participated in the NCAA Division I men's basketball and football and was a regular participant in the men's basketball tournament. In 1935, the University of Chicago reached the Sweet Sixteen.[202]In 1935,Chicago Maroons footballplayerJay Berwangerbecame the first winner of theHeisman Trophy. However, the university chose to withdraw from the Big Ten Conference in 1946 after University presidentRobert Maynard Hutchinsde-emphasized varsity athletics in 1939 and dropped football.[203]In 1969, Chicago reinstated football as a Division III team, resuming playing its home games at the newStagg Field. UChicago is also the home of theultimate frisbeeteam UChicago Fission.[204]
Student life
Student organizations
Students at the University of Chicago operate more than 400 clubs and organizations known as Recognized Student Organizations (RSOs).[206][207]These include cultural and religious groups, academic clubs and teams, and common-interest organizations.[207]Notable extracurricular groups include the University of Chicago College Bowl Team, which has won 118 tournaments and 15 national championships, leading both categories internationally. The university's competitive Model United Nations team was the top-ranked team in North America in 2013–2014, 2014–2015, 2015–2016, and again for the 2017–2018 season. The university's Model UN team is also the first to be in the top 5 for almost a decade, according to Best Delegate. Among notable student organizations are the nation's longest continuously running student film societyDoc Films; the organizing committee for theUniversity of Chicago Scavenger Hunt; the weekly student newspaperThe Chicago Maroon; the satiricalChicago Shady Dealer;[208]an improvisational theater and sketch comedy groupOff-Off Campus;The Blue Chips, an investing club managing $150k in assets;UT, performing up to 12 shows a year across campus[citation needed]; andUCJAS, organizers of UChi-Con, a yearlyanime convention[209]
The University of Chicago is home to eight student-run a cappella groups, several of which compete regularly at the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA). The school's two most prominent co-ed a cappella groups areVoices in Your Head, which competed at the ICCA finals in 2012, 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2022, as well as the Ransom Notes, which competed at the ICCA finals in 2021. Other successful a cappella groups on campus include the soprano-alto group Cadenza (formerly “Unaccompanied Women”), which is also the school's oldest established group, as well as the tenor-bass group Run For Cover, which performs in prolific events across the Midwest every year.[citation needed]
All recognized student organizations, from theUniversity of Chicago Scavenger Huntto Model UN, in addition to academic teams, sports clubs, arts groups, and more are funded byThe University of Chicago Student Government. Student Government consists of graduate and undergraduate students elected to represent members from their respective academic units. It is led by an executive committee, chaired by a president with the assistance of two vice presidents, one for administration and the other for student life, elected together as a slate by the student body each spring. Its annual budget is greater than $2 million.[210]
Fraternities and sororities
There are 13fraternitiesat the university. In 2017, approximately 20 to 25 percent of students were members of fraternities or sororities.[211]Numbers published in 2007 by the student activities office stated that one in ten undergraduates participated in Greek life.[212]
Student housing
On-campus undergraduate students at the University of Chicago participate in ahouse systemin which each student is assigned to one of the university's sevenresidence hallbuildings and to a smaller community within their residence hall called a "house". There are 39 houses, with an average of 70 students in each house.[213]The houses are named after former professors and other historical figures in the university community, such asEugene Fama.
Traditionally only first years were required to live in housing, but starting with the Class of 2023, students are required to live in housing for the first 2 years of enrollment.[214]About 60% of undergraduate students live on campus.[214]
For graduate students, the university owns and operates 28 apartment buildings near campus.[215]
Traditions
Every May since 1987, the University of Chicago has held theUniversity of Chicago Scavenger Hunt, in which large teams of students compete to obtain notoriously esoteric items from a list.[216]Every January, the university holds a week-long winter festival, Kuviasungnerk/Kangeiko (Kuvia), which includes early morning exercise routines and fitness workshops. The university also annually holds a summer carnival and concert called Summer Breeze that hosts outside musicians and is home toDoc Films, a student film society founded in 1932 that screens films nightly at the university. Since 1946, the university has organized theLatke-Hamantash Debate, which involves humorous discussions about the relative merits and meanings oflatkesandhamantashen.[citation needed]

Stanford University
Stanford University(officiallyLeland Stanford Junior University)[11][12]is aprivateresearch universityinStanford, California, United States. It was founded in 1885 by railroad magnateLeland Stanford, the eighthgovernorof and then-incumbentsenator from California, and his wife,Jane, in memory of their only child,Leland Jr.[2]
The university admitted its first students in 1891,[2][3]opening as acoeducationalandnon-denominationalinstitution. It struggled financially after Leland died in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the1906 San Francisco earthquake.[13]FollowingWorld War II, universityprovostFrederick Termaninspired anentrepreneurial cultureto build a self-sufficient local industry (laterSilicon Valley).[14]In 1951, theStanford Research Parkwas established inPalo Altoand is the world's first university research park.[15]By 2021, the university had 2,288 tenure-line faculty, senior fellows, center fellows, and medical faculty on staff.[16]
The university is organized around seven schools of study on an 8,180-acre (3,310-hectare) campus, one of the largest in the nation.[6]It houses theHoover Institution, a public policythink tank, and isclassifiedamong "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".[17]Students compete in 36 varsity sports, and the university is one of eight private institutions in theAtlantic Coast Conference(ACC). Stanford has won 131NCAAteam championships,[18]and was awarded theNACDA Directors' Cupfor 25 consecutive years, beginning in 1994.[19]Students and alumni have won302 Olympic medals (including 153 gold).[20]
The university is associated with74 living billionaires,[21]58Nobel laureates,[16]33MacArthur Fellows,[16]29Turing Awardwinners,[note 1]as well as 7Wolf Foundation Prizerecipients, 2 Supreme Court Justices of the United States, and 4Pulitzer Prizewinners.[16]Additionally, its alumni include manyFulbright Scholars,Marshall Scholars,Gates Cambridge Scholars,Rhodes Scholars, and members of theUnited States Congress.[42]
History
Stanford University was founded in 1885 byLelandandJane Stanford, dedicated to the memory ofLeland Stanford Jr., their only child. The institution opened in 1891 on Stanford's previous Palo Alto farm. The Stanfords modeled their university after the great Eastern universities, specificallyCornell UniversityinIthaca, New York. Stanford was referred to as the "Cornell of the West" in 1891 due to a majority of its faculty being former Cornell affiliates, including its first president,David Starr Jordan, and second president,John Casper Branner. Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to make higher education accessible, non-sectarian, and open to women as well as men. Cornell is credited as one of the first American universities to adopt that radical departure from traditional education, and Stanford became an early adopter as well.[43]
From an architectural point of view, the Stanfords wanted their university to look different and sought to emulate the style of English university buildings. They specified in the founding grant that the buildings should "be like the old adobe houses of the early Spanish days; they will be one-storied; they will have deep window seats and open fireplaces, and the roofs will be covered with the familiar dark red tiles."[45]The Stanfords also hired renowned landscape architectFrederick Law Olmsted, who previously designed the Cornell campus, to design the Stanford campus.[46]
WhenLeland Stanforddied in 1893, the continued existence of the university was put in jeopardy due to a federal lawsuit against his estate, butJane Stanfordinsisted the university remain in operation throughout the financial crisis.[47][48]The university suffered major damage from the1906 San Francisco earthquake; most of the damage was repaired, but a new library and gymnasium were demolished, and some original features ofMemorial Churchand theQuadwere never restored.[49]During the early-20th century, the university added four professional graduate schools.Stanford University School of Medicinewas established in 1908 when the university acquiredCooper Medical Collegein San Francisco;[50]it moved to the Stanford campus in 1959.[51]
The university's law department, established as an undergraduate curriculum in 1893, was transitioned into a professionallaw schoolstarting in 1908 and received accreditation from theAmerican Bar Associationin 1923.[52]TheStanford University Graduate School of Educationgrew out of the Department of the History and Art of Education, one of the original twenty-one departments at Stanford, and became a professional graduate school in 1917.[53]TheStanford Graduate School of Businesswas founded in 1925 at the urging of then-trusteeHerbert Hoover.[54]In 1919,The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peacewas started byHerbert Hooverto preserve artifacts related toWorld War I. TheSLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, established in 1962, performs research in particle physics.[55]
In the 1940s and 1950s,Frederick Terman, an engineering professor who later became provost, encouraged Stanford engineering graduates to start their own companies and invent products.[56]During the 1950s, he establishedStanford Industrial Park, a high-tech commercial campus on university land.[57]Also in the 1950s,William Shockley, co-inventor of the silicon transistor, recipient of the 1956Nobel Prize for Physics, and later professor of physics at Stanford, moved to the Palo Alto area and founded a company,Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. The next year,eight of his employeesresigned and formed a competing company,Fairchild Semiconductor. The presence of so many high-tech and semiconductor firms helped to establish Stanford and the mid-Peninsulaas a hotbed of innovation, eventually namedSilicon Valleyafter the key ingredient in transistors.[58]Shockley and Terman are both often described as the "fathers of Silicon Valley".[59][60]
In the 1950s,Stanford intentionallyreduced and restricted Jewish admissions, and for decades, denied and dismissed claims from students, parents, and alumni that they were doing so.[61]Stanford issued its first institutional apology to the Jewish community in 2022 after an internal task force confirmed that the university deliberately discriminated against Jewish applicants, while also misleading those who expressed concerns, including students, parents, alumni, and theADL.[62][63]Stanford was once considered a school for "the wealthy",[64]but controversies in later decades damaged its reputation. The 1971Stanford prison experimentwas criticized as unethical,[65]and the misuse of government funds from 1981 resulted in severe penalties for the school's research funding,[66][67]and the resignation of PresidentDonald Kennedyin 1992.[68]
In the 1960s, Stanford rose from a regional university to one of the most prestigious in the United States, "when it appeared on lists of the "top ten" universities in America... This swift rise to performance [was] understood at the time as related directly to the university's defense contracts..."[69]Wallace Sterlingwas the President from 1949 to 1968 and he oversaw the growth of Stanford from a financially troubled regional university to a financially sound, internationally recognized academic powerhouse, "the Harvard of the West".[70]Achievements during Sterling's tenure included:
Land
Most of Stanford is on an 8,180-acre (12.8 sq mi; 33.1 km2)[6]campus, one of the largest in the United States.[note 2]It is on theSan Francisco Peninsula, in the northwest part of theSanta Clara Valley(Silicon Valley) approximately 37 miles (60 km) southeast ofSan Franciscoand approximately 20 miles (30 km) northwest ofSan Jose. Stanford received $4.5 billion in 2006 and spent more than $2.1 billion in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. In 2008, 60% of this land remained undeveloped.[73]
Stanford's main campus includes acensus-designated placewithinunincorporatedSanta Clara County,[74]although some of the university land (such as theStanford Shopping Centerand theStanford Research Park) is within the city limits ofPalo Alto. The campus also includes much land in unincorporatedSan Mateo County(including theSLAC National Accelerator Laboratoryand theJasper Ridge Biological Preserve), as well as in the city limits ofMenlo Park(Stanford Hills neighborhood),Woodside, andPortola Valley.[75]
The central campus includes a seasonal lake (Lake Lagunita, an irrigation reservoir), home to the vulnerableCalifornia tiger salamander. As of 2012,Lake Lagunitawas often dry and the university had no plans to artificially fill it.[76]Heavy rains in January 2023 refilled Lake Lagunita to up to 8 feet of depth.[77]Two other reservoirs,Searsville LakeonSan Francisquito Creekand Felt Lake,[78]are on more remote sections of the founding grant.
Central campus
The central campus is adjacent to Palo Alto,[79]bounded byEl Camino Real, Stanford Avenue, Junipero Serra Blvd, andSand Hill Road, offState Route 82. TheUnited States Postal Servicehas assigned it twoZIP Codes: 94305 for campus mail and 94309 forP.O. boxmail. It lies withinarea code 650.
Non-central campus

Faculty residences
Many Stanford faculty members live in the "Faculty Ghetto", within walking or biking distance of campus.[93]The Faculty Ghetto is composed of land owned by Stanford. Similar to acondominium, the houses can be bought and sold to other Stanford faculty but the land under the houses is leased for 51 years with the possibility of extensions. Houses in the "Ghetto" appreciate and depreciate, but not as rapidly as overallSilicon Valleyvalues.[94]
Other uses
Some of the land is managed to provide revenue for the university such as theStanford Shopping Centerand theStanford Research Park. Stanford land is also leased for a token rent by thePalo Alto Unified School Districtfor several schools includingPalo Alto High SchoolandGunn High School.[95]El Camino Park, the oldest Palo Alto city park, is also on Stanford land.[96]Stanford also has the Stanford Golf Course,[97]and Stanford Red Barn Equestrian Center,[98]used by Stanford athletics though the golf course can also be used by the general public.
Landmarks
Contemporary campus landmarks include theMain QuadandMemorial Church, theCantor Center for Visual Artsand theBing Concert Hall, theStanford Mausoleumwith the nearbyAngel of Grief,Hoover Tower, theRodinSculpture Garden, thePapua New Guinea Sculpture Garden, theArizona Cactus Garden, theStanford University Arboretum,Green Libraryandthe Dish.Frank Lloyd Wright's 1937Hanna–Honeycomb Houseand the 1919Lou Henry Hoover Houseare both listed on theNational Register of Historic Places.White Memorial Fountain(also known as "The Claw") between the Stanford Bookstore and the Old Union is a popular place to meet and to engage in the Stanford custom of "fountain hopping"; it was installed in 1964 and designed byAristides Demetriosafter a national competition as a memorial for two brothers in the class of 1949, William White and John White II, one of whom died before graduating and one shortly after in 1952.[99][100][101][102]
Administration and organization
Stanford is a private, non-profit university administered as acorporate trustgoverned by a privately appointedboard of trusteeswith a maximum membership of 38.[103][note 3]Trustees serve five-year terms (not more than two consecutive terms) and meet five times annually.[106]A new trustee is chosen by the current trustees by ballot.[104]The Stanford trustees also oversee theStanford Research Park, theStanford Shopping Center, theCantor Center for Visual Arts,Stanford University Medical Center, and many associated medical facilities (including theLucile Packard Children's Hospital).[107]
The board appoints a president to serve as the chief executive officer of the university, to prescribe the duties of professors and course of study, to manage financial and business affairs, and to appoint nine vice presidents.[108]Richard Sallerbecame the interim president in September 2023.[109]On April 4, 2024, the board of trustees announced thatJonathan Levinwould become the thirteenth president on August 1, 2024.[110]The provost is the chief academic and budget officer, to whom the deans of each of the seven schools report.[111][112]Jenny Martinezbecame the fourteenth provost in October 2023.[113]The university is organized into seven academic schools.[114]
The schools ofHumanities and Sciences(twenty-seven departments),[115]Engineering(nine departments),[116]andSustainability(nine departments)[117]have both graduate and undergraduate programs while the Schools ofLaw,[118]Medicine,[119]Education,[120]andBusiness[121]have graduate programs only. The powers and authority of the faculty are vested in the Academic Council, which is made up of tenure and non-tenure line faculty, research faculty, senior fellows in some policy centers and institutes, the president of the university, and some other academic administrators.[122]But most matters are handled by the Faculty Senate, made up of 54 elected representatives of the faculty for 2021.[123]
The Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) is the student government for Stanford and all registered students are members. Its elected leadership consists of the Undergraduate Senate elected by the undergraduate students, the Graduate Student Council elected by the graduate students, and the President and Vice President elected as aticketby the entire student body.[124]Stanford is the beneficiary of a special clause in theCalifornia Constitution, which explicitly exempts Stanford property from taxation so long as the property is used for educational purposes.[125]
Endowment, assets, and donations
Stanford's endowment includes real estate and other investments valued at $36.5 billion as of August 2023,[126]and is one of the fourlargest academic endowmentsin the United States.[127]The endowment consists of $29.9 billion in a merged pool of assets and $6.6 billion of real estate near the main campus. Stanford is the largest landowner in the Silicon Valley[128]Payouts from the endowment covered approximately 22% of university expenses in the 2023 fiscal year.[129]
Since inception, the university has been the beneficiary of large donations. The endowment began in 1885, six years before the opening of the university, when Leland Stanford and his wife Jane conveyed approximately $20 million to the university.[130]The university's pioneering of technology intellectual property transfer created both direct investments and enabled a unique pipeline of mega-donors[131]including from alumni-founded companies withGoogle(Sergey BrinandLarry Page),Nike(Phil Knight),[132]Hewlett-Packard(David PackardandBill Hewlett),[133]andSun Microsystems(Vinod Kohsla)[134]as examples. Further, the university's global reputation[135]and continued leadership in technology[136]has attracted large donations from prominent figures such as the co-founder ofNetscape(Jim Clark),[137]founder ofSAP SE(Hasso Plattner),[138]co-founder ofAndreessen Horowitz(Marc AndreessenandLaura Arillaga-Andreessen),[139]chairman ofKleiner Perkins(John Doerrand his wife Ann).[140]
Academics
Admissions
Stanford is considered byUS Newsto be 'most selective' with an acceptance rate of 4%, one of the lowest 
among US universities. Half of the applicants accepted to Stanford have anSATscore between 1440 and 1570 or anACTscore between 32 and 35, typically with a GPA of 3.94 or higher. Admissions officials consider a student'sgrade point averageto be an important academic factor, with emphasis on an applicant's high school class rank and letters of recommendation.[146]In terms of non-academic materials as of 2019, Stanford ranks extracurricular activities, talent/ability and character/personal qualities as 'very important' in making first-time, first-year admission decisions, while ranking the interview, whether the applicant is a first-generation university applicant,legacy preferences, volunteer work and work experience as 'considered'.[143][147]Of those students accepted to Stanford's Class of 2026, 1,736 chose to attend, of which 21% were first-generation college students.
Stanford's admission process isneed-blindfor U.S. citizens and permanent residents;[148]while it is not need-blind for international students, 64% are on need-based aid, with an average aid package of $31,411.[149]In 2012, the university awarded $126 million in need-based financial aid to 3,485 students, with an average aid package of $40,460.[149]Eighty percent of students receive some form of financial aid.[149]Stanford has a no-loan policy.[149]For undergraduates admitted starting in 2015, Stanford waives tuition, room, and board for most families with incomes below $65,000, and most families with incomes below $125,000 are not required to pay tuition; those with incomes up to $150,000 may have tuition significantly reduced.[150]Seventeen percent of students receivePell Grants,[149]a common measure of low-income students at a college. In 2022, Stanford started its first dual-enrollment computer science program for high school students from low-income communities,[151]as a pilot project which then inspired the founding of the Qualia Global Scholars Program.[152]Stanford plans to expand the program to include courses in Structured Liberal Education and writing.[151]
Teaching and learning
Stanford follows a quarter system with the autumn quarter usually beginning in late September and the spring quarter ending in mid-June.[17]The full-time, four-year undergraduate program has arts and sciences focus with high graduate student coexistence.[17]Stanford is accredited by theWestern Association of Schools and Collegeswith the latest review in 2023.[153]
Research centers and institutes
Stanford isclassifiedamong "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity."[17]The university's research expenditure in fiscal years of 2021/22 was $1.82 billion and the total number of sponsored projects was 7,900.[154]By 2016, the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research oversaweighteen independent laboratories, centers, and institutes.Kathryn Ann Moleris the key person for leading those research centers for choosing problems, faculty members, and students. Funding is also provided for undergraduate and graduate students by those labs, centers, and institutes for collaborative research.[155]Other Stanford-affiliated institutions include theSLAC National Accelerator Laboratory(originally the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center), theStanford Research Institute(an independent institution which originated at the university), theHoover Institution(a conservativethink tank),[156]and theHasso Plattner Institute of Design(a multidisciplinary design school in cooperation with theHasso Plattner InstituteofUniversity of Potsdamthat integrates product design, engineering, and business management education).
Stanford is home to theMartin Luther King Jr.Research and Education Institute, which grew out of and still contains the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project, a collaboration with theKing Centerto publish the King papers held by the King Center.[157]It also runs theJohn S. Knight Fellowship for Professional Journalistsand the Center for Ocean Solutions, which brings together marine science and policy to address challenges facing the ocean. It focuses on five points: climate change, overfishing, coastal development, pollution, and plastics.[158]Together withUC BerkeleyandUC San Francisco, Stanford is part of theBiohub, a new medical science research center founded in 2016 by a $600 million commitment from Facebook CEO and founderMark Zuckerbergand pediatricianPriscilla Chan. This medical research center is working for designing advanced-level health care units.[159]
Libraries and digital resources
By 2014,Stanford University Libraries(SUL) had twenty-four libraries in total. TheHoover Institution Library and Archivesis a research center based on history of 20th-century.[160]Stanford University Libraries(SUL) held a collection of more than 9.3 million volumes, nearly 300,000 rare or special books, 1.5 million e-books, 2.5 million audiovisual materials, 77,000 serials, nearly 6 million microform holdings, and thousands of other digital resources.[161][162]The main library in the SU library system is theGreen Library, which also contains various meeting and conference rooms, study spaces, and reading rooms.Lathrop Library(previouslyMeyer Library, demolished in 2015), holds various student-accessible media resources and houses one of the largestEast Asiacollections with 540,000 volumes.Stanford University Press, founded in 1892, published about 130 books per year has printed more than 3,000 books.[163]It also has fifteen subject areas.[164]
TheStanford Encyclopedia of Philosophyis a leadingonline encyclopediaand academic resource on the subject ofphilosophy, published and maintained by the university. The encyclopedia was founded by Stanford senior researcherEdward Zaltain 1995.[165]
Arts
Stanford is home to theCantor Center for Visual Arts, a museum established with the help of art collectorB. Gerald Cantor. It today consists of twenty-four galleries, sculpture gardens, terraces, and a courtyard first established in 1891 by Jane and Leland Stanford as a memorial to their only child. The university's collection of works byAuguste Rodinis among the largest in the world,[166]with as many as 200 sculptures at the Cantor Center alone. These include an original bronze cast ofThe Thinkergranted residence at Stanford by Cantor in 1988, with the university expected to attain full ownership sometime in the future. The StanfordThinkerhas been loaned for viewing around the world and features across the university's iconography and culture,[167][168]including the logo of theEncyclopedia of Philosophy.
TheThomas Welton StanfordGallery, which was built in 1917, serves as a teaching resource for the Department of Art & Art History as well as an exhibition venue. In 2014, Stanford opened the Anderson Collection, a new museum focused on postwar American art and founded by the donation of 121 works by food service moguls Mary andHarry Anderson.[169][170][171]There are outdoor art installations throughout the campus, primarily sculptures, but some murals as well. The Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden near Roble Hall features wood carvings and "totem poles."
The Stanford music department sponsors many ensembles, including five choirs, the Stanford Symphony Orchestra,Stanford Taiko, and the Stanford Wind Ensemble. Extracurricular activities include theater groups such as Ram's Head Theatrical Society, the Stanford Improvisors,[172]the Stanford Shakespeare Company, and the Stanford Savoyards, a group dedicated to performing the works ofGilbert and Sullivan. Stanford is also host totena cappellagroups, including theMendicants(Stanford's first),[173]Counterpoint(the first all-female group on theWest Coast),[174]the Harmonics, theStanford Fleet Street Singers,[175]Talisman,Everyday People,and Raagapella.[176]
Reputation and rankings
Stanford is widely considered one of the most prestigious universities in the world by leading sources includingU.S. News & World Report,[184]Times Higher Education,[185]andQS World University Rankings.[186]As noted inThe Wall Street Journal's 2024 rankings, "the usual players are almost always going to come out on top: The Princetons, the Stanfords, the Yales, the Harvards. They will jockey for those first few spots on whatever ranking you happen to be looking."[187]
In 2022,Washington Monthlyranked Stanford at 1st position in their annual list of top universities in the United States.[188]In 2019, Stanford University took 1st place on Reuters' list of theWorld's Most Innovative Universitiesfor the fifth consecutive year.[189]Stanford Graduate School of Businesshas consistently been both the most selective business school in the world[190]and consistently ranked 1st in the list of bestbusiness schoolsyear-over-year consecutively by various reputed studies includingBloomberg Businessweek[191]andU.S. News & World Reportfor 2024.[192]Stanford Law Schoolis also consistently been amongst the two most selective law schools in the world[193]and consistently ranked 1st in the list of best law schools year-over-year consecutively for 2024 inU.S. News & World Report.[194]
In a 2022 survey byThe Princeton Review, Stanford was ranked 1st among the top ten "dream colleges" of America, and was considered to be the ultimate "dream college" of both students and parents.[195][196]From polls of college applicants done byThe Princeton Review, every year from 2013 to 2020 the most commonly named "dream college" for students was Stanford; separately, parents, too, most frequently named Stanford their ultimate "dream college."[197][198]TheAcademic Ranking of World Universities(ARWU)ranked Stanford second in the world (after Harvard) most years from 2003 to 2020.[199]Times Higher Educationrecognizes Stanford as one of the world's "six super brands" on itsWorld Reputation Rankings, along withBerkeley,Cambridge,Harvard,MIT, andOxford.[200][201]
Discoveries and innovation

Businesses and entrepreneurship
Stanford is one of the most successful universities worldwide in creating companies and licensing its inventions to existing companies, and it is often considered the model fortechnology transfer.[226][227]Stanford's Office of Technology Licensing is responsible for commercializing university research, intellectual property, and university-developed projects. The university is described as having a strong venture culture in which students are encouraged, and oftenfunded, to launch their own companies.[228]Companies founded by Stanford alumni generate more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue and have created some 5.4 million jobs since the 1930s.[229]When combined, these companies would form the tenth-largest economy in the world.[230]
Some notable companies closely associated with Stanford and their connections include:
Student life
Student body
Stanford enrolled 6,996 undergraduate and 10,253 graduate students in the 2019–2020 school year. Women made up 50.4% of undergraduates and 41.5% of graduate students.[149]In the same academic year, the freshman retention rate was 99%. Stanford awarded 1,819 undergraduate degrees, 2,393 master's degrees, 770 doctoral degrees, and 3270 professional degrees in the 2018–2019 school year.[149]The four-year graduation rate for the class of 2017 cohort was 72.9%, and the six-year rate was 94.4%.[149]The relatively low four-year graduation rate is a function of the university's coterminal degree (or "coterm") program, which allows students to earn a master's degree as a 1-to-2-year extension of their undergraduate program.[251]In 2010, 15% of undergraduates were first-generation students.[252]
Dormitories and student housing
By 2013, 89% of undergraduate students lived in on-campus university housing. First-year undergraduates are required to live on campus, and all undergraduates are guaranteed housing for all four undergraduate years.[149][253]Undergraduates live in 80 different houses, including dormitories, co-ops,row houses, andfraternities and sororities.[254]At Manzanita Park, 118mobile homeswere installed as "temporary" housing from 1969 to 1991, but have become the site of newer dorms Castano, Kimball, Lantana, and the Humanities House, completed in 2015.[255][256]Most student residences are just outside the campus core, within ten minutes (on foot or bike) of most classrooms and libraries. Some are reserved for freshmen, sophomores, or upper-class students and some are open to all four classes. Most residences are co-ed; seven are all-malefraternities, three are all-femalesororities, and there is also one all-female non-sorority house, Roth House. In most residences, men and women live on the same floor, but some have single-gender floors.[257]
Several residences are considered "theme" houses; predating the current classification system are Columbae (Social Change Through Nonviolence, since 1970),[258]and Synergy (Exploring Alternatives, since 1972).[259]The Academic, Language, and Culture Houses include EAST (Education and Society Themed House), Hammarskjöld (International Themed House), Haus Mitteleuropa (Central European Themed House), La Casa Italiana (Italian Language and Culture), La Maison Française (French Language and Culture House), Slavianskii Dom (Slavic/East European Themed House), Storey (Human Biology Themed House), and Yost (Spanish Language and Culture). Cross-Cultural Themed Houses include Casa Zapata (Chicano/Latino Theme in Stern Hall), Muwekma-tah-ruk (American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Themed House), Okada (Asian-American Themed House in Wilbur Hall), and Ujamaa (Black/African-American Themed House in Lagunita Court). Focus Houses includeFreshman-Sophomore College(Academic Focus),Branner Hall(Community Service), Kimball (Arts & Performing Arts), Crothers (Global Citizenship), andToyon(Sophomore Priority).[254]Co-opsor "Self-Ops" are another housing option.
These houses feature cooperative living, where residents and eating associates each contribute work to keep the house running, such as cooking meals or cleaning shared spaces. These houses have unique themes around which their community is centered. Many co-ops are hubs of music, art and philosophy. The co-ops on campus are 576 Alvarado Row (formerly Chi Theta Chi), Columbae, Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), Hammarskjöld, Kairos, Terra (the unofficialLGBThouse),[260]and Synergy.[261]Phi Sigma, at 1018 Campus Drive was formerlyPhi Sigma Kappafraternity, but in 1973 became a Self-Op.[262]By 2015, 55 percent of the graduate student population lived on campus.[263]Stanford also subsidizes off-campus apartments in nearbyPalo Alto,Menlo Park, andMountain Viewfor graduate students who are guaranteed on-campus housing but are unable to live on campus due to a lack of space.[264]
Athletics
In 2016, Stanford had sixteen male varsity sports and twenty female varsity sports,[265]nineteen club sports,[266]and about 27 intramural sports.[267]TheStanford Treeis theStanford Band's mascot and the unofficialmascotof Stanford University. Stanford's team name is the "Cardinal", referring to the vividStanford Cardinal Redcolor (not thecommon songbirdas at several other schools); the university does not have an official mascot. The Tree has been called one of America's most bizarre and controversial college mascots;[268]it regularly appears at the top of Internet "worst mascot" lists,[269][270][271][272]but has also appeared on at least one list of top mascots.[273]The Tree is a member of theLeland Stanford Junior University Marching Band(LSJUMB) and appears atfootballgames,basketballgames, and other events where the band performs.[274]
In 1930, following a unanimous vote by the executive committee for the Associated Students, the athletic department adopted a new mascot (Indian). The Indian symbol and name were dropped by PresidentRichard Lymanin 1972, after objections fromNative Americanstudents and a vote by the student senate.[275]Stanford is a member of theAtlantic Coast Conferencein most sports, theMountain Pacific Sports Federationin several other sports, and theAmerica East Conferenceinfield hockeywith the participation in the inter-collegiateNCAA'sDivision IFBS.[276]The two official colors of the university areStanford Cardinal RedandPalo Alto Green.[277]
From 1930 until 1972, Stanford's sports teams had been known as the Indians and during the period from 1951 to 1972, Prince Lightfoot (portrayed by Timm Williams, a member of theYurok tribe) was the official mascot. But in 1972,Native Americanstudents and staff members successfully lobbied University PresidentRichard Lymanto abolish the "Indian" name along with what they had come to perceive as an offensive and demeaning mascot. Stanford's teams reverted unofficially to the name "Cardinal", the color that had represented the school before 1930.[278]
From 1972 until 1981, Stanford’s official nickname was the Cardinal, but, during this time, there was debate among students and administrators concerning what the mascot and team name should be. A 1972 student referendum on the issue was in favor of restoring the Indian, while a second 1975 referendum was against. The 1975 vote included new suggestions, many alluding to the industry of the school's founder,tycoonLeland Stanford: theRobber Barons, the Sequoias, the Trees, the Cardinals, the Railroaders, the Spikes, and the Huns.
Its traditional sports rival is theUniversity of California, Berkeley. The winner of the annual "Big Game" between theCalandCardinalfootball teams gains custody ofthe Stanford Axe.[279]
As of May 23, 2024, Stanford has won 136 NCAA team championships, more than any other school. Stanford has won at least one NCAA team championship each academic year for 48 consecutive years, from 1976–77 through to 2023–24.[280]As of January 1, 2022, Stanford athletes have also won 529 NCAA individual championships. No other Division I school is within 100 of Stanford's total.[281]Stanford have won 25 consecutive NACDA Directors' Cups, from 1994–1995 through to 2018–19, awarded annually to the most successful overall college sports program in the nation.[280]177 Stanford-affiliated athletes have won a total of 296 Summer Olympic medals (150 gold, 79 silver, 67 bronze), including 26 medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and 27 medals at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.[280]In the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Stanford-affiliated athletes won 26 medals, more than any other university.[282]
Traditions
Religious life
Students and staff at Stanford are of many different religions. The Stanford Office for Religious Life's mission is "to guide, nurture and enhance spiritual, religious and ethical life within the Stanford University community" by promoting enriching dialogue, meaningful ritual, and enduring friendships among people of all religious backgrounds. It is headed by a dean with the assistance of a senior associate dean and an associate dean.Stanford Memorial Church, in the center of campus, has a Sunday University Public Worship service (UPW) usually in the "Protestant Ecumenical Christian" tradition where the Memorial Church Choir sings and a sermon is preached usually by one of the Stanford deans for Religious Life. UPW sometimes has multifaith services. In addition, the church is used by the Catholic community and the other Christian denominations at Stanford. Weddings happen most Saturdays and the university has allowed blessings of same-gender relationships and legal weddings.[307]
In addition to the church, the Office for Religious Life has a Center for Inter-Religious Community, Learning, and Experiences (CIRCLE) on the third floor of Old Union. It offers a common room, an interfaith sanctuary, a seminar room, a student lounge area, and a reading room, as well as offices housing a number of Stanford Associated Religions (SAR) member groups and the Senior Associate Dean and Associate Dean for Religious Life. Most though not all religious student groups belong to SAR. The SAR directory includes organizations that serve atheist,Bahá’í, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Jewish, and Sikh groups, though these groups vary year by year.[308]The Windhover Contemplation Center was dedicated in October 2014, and was intended to provide spiritual sanctuary for students and staff in the midst of their course and work schedules; the center displays the "Windhover" paintings byNathan Oliveira, the late Stanford professor and artist.[309]Some religions have a larger and more formal presence on campus in addition to the student groups; these include the Catholic and Hillel communities at Stanford.[310][311]
Greek life
Fraternities and sororities have been active on the Stanford campus since 1891 when the university first opened. In 1944, University PresidentDonald Tresidderbanned all Stanford sororities due to extreme competition.[312]However, followingTitle IX, the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on sororities in 1977.[313]Students are not permitted to join a fraternity or sorority until spring quarter of their freshman year.[314]Stanford has thirty-one Greek organizations, including fourteen sororities and sixteen fraternities. Nine of the Greek organizations were housed (eight in University-owned houses and one,Sigma Chi, in their own house, although the land is owned by the university).[315]Five chapters were members of the African American Fraternal and Sororal Association, eleven chapters were members of the Interfraternity Council, seven chapters belonged to the Intersorority Council, and six chapters belonged to the Multicultural Greek Council.[316]
Student groups
Stanford has more than 600 student organizations.[317]Groups are often, though not always, partially funded by the university via allocations directed by the student government organization, the ASSU. These funds include "special fees," which are decided by a Spring Quarter vote by the student body. Groups span athletics and recreation, careers/pre-professional, community service, ethnic/cultural, fraternities and sororities, health and counseling, media and publications, the arts, political and social awareness, and religious and philosophical organizations. In contrast to many other selective universities, Stanford policy mandates that all recognized student clubs be "broadly open" for all interested students to join.[318][319][320][321]
The Stanford Dailyis a student-run daily newspaper and has been published since the university was founded in 1892.[322]The student-run radio station,KZSUStanford 90.1 FM, features freeform music programming, sports commentary, and news segments; it started in 1947 as an AM radio station.[323]The Stanford Reviewis a conservative student newspaper founded in 1987.[324]The Fountain Hopper(FoHo) is a financially independent, anonymous student-run campusragpublication, notable for having broken theBrock Turner story.[325]Stanford hosts numerous environmental and sustainability-oriented student groups, including Students for a Sustainable Stanford, Students for Environmental and Racial Justice, and Stanford Energy Club.[326]Stanford is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.[327]
Stanford is also home to a large number of pre-professional student organizations, organized around missions from startup incubation to paid consulting. TheBusiness Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students(BASES) is one of the largest professional organizations in Silicon Valley, with over 5,000 members.[328]Its goal is to support the next generation of entrepreneurs.[329]StartXis a non-profit startup accelerator for student and faculty-ledstartups.[330]It is staffed primarily by students.[331]Stanford Women In Business (SWIB) is an on-campus business organization, aimed at helping Stanford women find paths to success in the generally male-dominated technology industry.[332]Stanford Marketing is a student group that provides students hands-on training through research and strategy consulting projects withFortune 500clients, as well as workshops led by people from industry and professors in theStanford Graduate School of Business.[333][334]Stanford Finance provides mentoring and internships for students who want to enter a career in finance. Stanford Pre Business Association is intended to build connections among industry, alumni, and student communities.[335]
Stanford is also home to several academic groups focused on government and politics, includingStanford in GovernmentandStanford Women in Politics. TheStanford Society for Latin American Politicsis Stanford's first student organization focused on the region's political, economic, and social developments, working to increase the representation and study ofLatin Americaon campus. Former guest speakers includeJosé MujicaandGustavo Petro.[336]Other groups include:
Safety
Stanford's Department of Public Safety is responsible for law enforcement and safety on the main campus. Its deputy sheriffs arepeace officersby arrangement with theSanta Clara County Sheriff's Office.[346]The department is also responsible for publishing an annual crime report covering the previous three years as required by theClery Act.[347]Fire protection has been provided by contract with the Palo Alto Fire Department since 1976.[348]Murder is rare on the campus, although a few cases have been notorious, including the 1974 murder ofArlis Perryin Stanford Memorial Church, which was not solved until 2018.[349]Also infamous wasTheodore Streleski's murder of his faculty advisor in 1978.[350]
In 2014, Stanford was the tenth highest in the nation in "total of reports of rape" on their main campus, with 26 reports of rape.[351]In Stanford's 2015 Campus Climate Survey, 4.7 percent of female undergraduates reported experiencing sexual assault as defined by the university, and 32.9 percent reported experiencing sexual misconduct.[352]According to the survey, 85% of perpetrators of misconduct were Stanford students and 80% were men.[352]Perpetrators of sexual misconduct were frequently aided by alcohol or drugs, according to the survey: "Nearly three-fourths of the students whose responses were categorized as sexual assault indicated that the act was accomplished by a person or persons taking advantage of them when they were drunk or high, according to the survey. Close to 70 percent of students who reported an experience of sexual misconduct involving nonconsensual penetration and/or oral sex indicated the same."[352]
Associated Students of Stanford and student and alumni activists with the anti-rape group Stand with Leah criticized the survey methodology for downgrading incidents involving alcohol if students did not check two separate boxes indicating they were both intoxicated and incapacity while sexually assaulted.[352]Reporting on the Brock Turner rape case, a reporter fromThe Washington Postanalyzed campus rape reports submitted by universities to the U.S. Department of Education, and found that Stanford was one of the top ten universities in campus rapes in 2014, with 26 reported that year, but when analyzed by rapes per 1000 students, Stanford was not among the top ten.[351]
On the night of January 17–18, 2015, 22-year-oldChanel Miller, who was visiting the campus to attend a party at theKappa Alphafraternity, was sexually assaulted by Brock Turner, a nineteen-year-old freshman student-athlete from Ohio. Two Stanford graduate students witnessed the attack and intervened; when Turner attempted to flee the two held him down on the ground until police arrived.[353]Stanford immediately referred the case to prosecutors and offered Miller counseling, and within two weeks had barred Turner from campus after conducting an investigation.[354]Turner was convicted on three felony charges in March 2016 and in June 2016 he received a jail sentence of six months and was declared a sex offender, requiring him to register as such for the rest of his life; prosecutors had sought a six-year prison sentence out of the maximum 14 years that was possible.[355]The case and the relatively lenient sentence drew nationwide attention.[356]Two years later, the judge in the case, Stanford graduateAaron Persky, was recalled by the voters.[357][358]
In February 2015, Elise Clougherty filed a sexual assault and harassment lawsuit against venture capitalistJoe Lonsdale.[359][360]Lonsdale and Clougherty entered into a relationship in the spring of 2012 when she was a junior and he was her mentor in a Stanford entrepreneurship course.[360]By the spring of 2013 Clougherty had broken off the relationship and filed charges at Stanford that Lonsdale had broken the Stanford policy against consensual relationships between students and faculty and that he had sexually assaulted and harassed her, which resulted in Lonsdale being banned from Stanford for 10 years.[360]Lonsdale challenged Stanford's finding that he had sexually assaulted and harassed her and Stanford rescinded that finding and the campus ban in the fall of 2015.[361]Clougherty withdrew her suit that fall as well.[362]
